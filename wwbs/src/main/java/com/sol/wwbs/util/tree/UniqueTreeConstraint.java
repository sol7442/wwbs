 * Implementers check unique constraints in a tree-table.

 * <p/>
 * Mind that this constraint implementation must be applied BEFORE setXxx() is called
 * on a domain object (POJO), as the JPA container might flush the setXxx() call to
 * database before the checker query is launched (then, of course, the wrong value
 * will be found by the query). Thus the application MUST call
 * <code>treeDao.checkUniqueConstraint()</code> BEFORE updating an unique property,
 * and it must do this using a clone of the persistent entity.
 * See <code>AbstractTreeTest.setName()</code> unit test method for an example how to do this.
