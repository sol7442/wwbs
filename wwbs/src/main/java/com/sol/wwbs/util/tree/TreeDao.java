/**
 * Tree DAO provides hierarchical access to records in a JPA database layer.
 * There can be more than one tree in a database table.
 * A record can not be in several trees at the same time.
 * A record can have one parent or no parent (root), but not several parents.
 * Normally there is no record that is not in a tree, except it is a root without children.
 * <p/>
 * This interface abstracts the functionality of a tree DAO so that the underlying
 * implementation can be replaced. In this library two such DAOs are implemented, 
 * one for a nested-sets-tree, one for a closure-table-tree.
 * <p/>
 * For more information see
 * <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data">Bill Karwin slides "Models for Hierarchical Data"</a>, page 40, and
