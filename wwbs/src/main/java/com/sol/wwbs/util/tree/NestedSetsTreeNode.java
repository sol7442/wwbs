/**
 * A tree node.
 * It represents a hierarchy of records in a database table without parent
 * references in children or vice versa. The hierarchy is managed via
 * <code>lft</code> and <code>rgt</code> depth-first order numbers directly
 * in the database record. To be able to store more than one tree in a table,
 * every node additionally has a reference to the top-level root node (not to its parent!).
 * <p/>
 * This interface must be implemented by any domain object that represents
 * hierarchical data and should be managed via <code>NestedSetsTreeDao</code>.
 * Do not use these interface methods outside (except clone()), they are for the DAO only.
 * <p/>
 * See http://www.klempert.de/nested_sets/ or Wikipedia "nested sets tree".
 * <P/>
 * <code>Cloneable</code> interface is required only for copy and unique
 * constraint checking. You can return null from clone() if neither is needed.
